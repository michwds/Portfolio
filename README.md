# Lab 4: Advanced CSS

In this lab, you will have the opportunity to build a two column page layout with CSS using the provided HTML and images with the use of margins and padding.  The goal is to style your web page so it appears similar to the image provided in the lab.  Detailed instructions can be found in the instructions pdf file.  Review the marking rubric to ensure you have addressed all points required for the page.  Ensure you keep a version on your page under version control as it may be used in subsequent weeks.  Also, please note the position of image and css files.  You must use relative paths and not move the location of these files.   You do not need to use a webserver to host your page for this lab.  You are only producing a single stylesheet for the lab.  **Do not modify the HTML code**.  Your CSS file must be placed in the css folder, relative to the lab4.html file.
